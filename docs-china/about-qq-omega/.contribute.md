## Contribute to QQ-omega 

QQ-omega is designed to evolve with the ecosystem: Community input is welcome to refine metrics, expand coverage and improve the overall quality of the datas.

### Propose New Metrics or Categories

If you have proposal for:

- easy way to get fastest real time data as possible
- New **metrics** we should track
- New **categories** of projects, narratives or entities

you can submit a proposal through the dedicated form:

👉 **Proposal Form:** `[Insert form link here]`

Please include:

- Clear name and description of the metric / category
- Why it matters (what problem it solves, what alpha it can unlock)
- Required data sources (on-chain, off-chain, social, etc.)
- Any example queries, dashboards or use cases

The team will review submissions periodically and may:

- Integrate them into the official framework
- Ask for clarifications or refinements
- Mark them as “experimental” for internal testing

### Feedback & Improvements

You can also contribute by sharing feedback on:

- Data coverage or accuracy
- Scoring logic, rankings, and output format
- UX of dashboards, docs and tooling
- Potential integrations or collaborations

Feedback can be sent through our **official channels** (listed on the main page of the docs / website).
Constructive, specific feedback has the highest chance of being integrated into future iterations of QQ.
