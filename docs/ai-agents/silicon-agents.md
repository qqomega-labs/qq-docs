## What is “green” – On-Chain Agents

“z” agents watch **On-chain behaviour**:

- **Holder distribution** (whales, concentration, retail share)
- **Smart money** (who is buying/selling, known wallets)
- **Liquidity** (where it is, how deep it is, fragmentation)
- **Activity** (number of active wallets, retention, flows between chains/CEX)

Their goal: answer “**What does the blockchain say about how people really use this token?**”
