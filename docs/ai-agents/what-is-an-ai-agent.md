## What is an `AI Agent`

In QQ, an **AI Agent** is a focused analytical module.  
Each agent:

- looks at a **specific area** (e.g. team, token supply, whales, charts, macro);
- reads **structured data**;
- outputs a **score, signal or comment** that can be combined with others.

Instead of one big model trying to do everything, QQ uses **many small specialists**.
