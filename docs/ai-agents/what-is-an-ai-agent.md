## What Is an AI Agent?

In QQ, an **AI Agent** is a small specialist.  
Think of it like a **doctor with one job**: one only checks the heart, another only checks the lungs, another only reads the blood tests.

Each agent:

- looks at **one hyper-specific area** (eg. team, token supply, whales, macro, etc.);
- reads **structured data and metrics**;
- outputs a **score, signal or comment** that can be combined with others.

An agent is not trying to understand “everything”.  
It is trying to be **very good at one thing**.

## What Is a Swarm?

A **swarm** is a **team of agents** that all work on the same big topic, but from different angles.

Imagine:

- a **hospital department** (cardiology, neurology, etc.): many doctors, one domain;
- or a **team of analysts** in the same division: everyone has their own model, but they all study the same asset class.

They share the same mission, but each one has its own dataset, rules, and way of scoring.

## Elements = Swarms of Agents

In QQ, each **Element** (Carbon, Gold, Hydrogen, Silicon, Oxygen, Phosphorus) is **not one agent**.  
Each Element is **a full swarm**: a cluster of narrow specialists working together.

You can read them like this:

- **Carbon swarm** → fundamentals experts  
  Agents focused on people, product, business model, governance, security, etc.

- **Gold swarm** → tokenomics experts  
  Agents focused on supply, inflation, burns, unlocks, buybacks, utility, yield, etc.

- **Hydrogen swarm** → on-chain flow experts  
  Agents focused on TVL, volumes, holder clusters, accumulation vs. distribution, etc.

- **Silicon swarm** → technical & quant experts  
  Agents focused on price action, VWAP, Fibonacci, supply/demand zones, trend and volatility regimes.

- **Oxygen swarm** → macro & regime experts  
  Agents focused on interest rates, liquidity, dominance, total market caps, fear & greed, seasonality.

- **Phosphorus swarm** → orchestration & scoring experts  
  Agents focused on combining all other swarms into area scores, a global QQ Score, and clear insights.

So:

- **Agent** = one small specialist with one job.
- **Swarm** = many agents focused on the same theme.
- **Element** (Carbon, Gold, Hydrogen, Silicon, Oxygen, Phosphorus) = **one swarm of agents** with a clear mandate.

QQ-Omega doesn’t rely on one “big brain” giving one opinion.  
It relies on **multiple swarms of specialists**, each with many agents inside, and then combines their views into a single, coherent picture.
