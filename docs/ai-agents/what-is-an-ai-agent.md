## What Is an AI Agent?

In QQ Omega, an **AI agent** is a small specialist.  
Think of it like a **doctor with one job**: one only checks the heart, another only checks the lungs, another only reads blood tests.

Each agent:
- looks at <span className="pink-glow-text">**one hyper-specific area**</span> (for example, team credibility, token unlocks, whale flows, central bank interest rates);  
- reads **structured data and metrics**;  
- outputs a **score, signal, or comment** that can be combined with others.

A single agent is not trying to understand everything.  
It is trying to be **very good at one thing**.

## What Is a Swarm?

A **swarm** is a <span className="pink-glow-text">**team of agents**</span> that all work on the same broad topic, from different angles.

Imagine:
- a **hospital department** (cardiology, neurology, and similar fields): many doctors, one domain;  
- or a **team of analysts** in the same division: everyone has their own model, but they all study the same asset class.

They share the same mission, but each agent has its own dataset, rules, and way of scoring.

## Elements = Swarms of Agents

In QQ Omega, each category (Fundamentals, Tokenomics, and others) is **a full swarm**: a cluster of narrow specialist AI agents working together.

Each category has one <span className="pink-glow-text">**Element**</span> associated with it:

- <span className="gradient-text">**Carbon swarm**</span> → **fundamentals** experts  
  Agents focused on people, product, business model, governance, security, and related factors.

- <span className="gradient-text">**Gold swarm**</span> → **tokenomics** experts  
  Agents focused on supply, inflation, burns, unlocks, buybacks, utility, yield, and similar mechanisms.

- <span className="gradient-text">**Hydrogen swarm**</span> → **on-chain flow** experts  
  Agents focused on TVL, volumes, holder clusters, accumulation versus distribution, and related behavior.

- <span className="gradient-text">**Silicon swarm**</span> → **technical and quantitative** experts  
  Agents focused on price action, relevant indicators, liquidations, and trend and volatility regimes.

- <span className="gradient-text">**Oxygen swarm**</span> → **macro and regime** experts  
  Agents focused on interest rates, global liquidity, dominance, total market capitalization, fear and greed, and seasonality.

- <span className="gradient-text">**Phosphorus swarm**</span> → **orchestration and scoring** experts  
  Agents focused on combining all other swarms into area scores, a global QQ Score, and clear insights.

So:
- **Agent** = one small specialist with one job.  
- **Swarm** = many agents focused on the same theme.  
- **Element** (Carbon, Gold, Hydrogen, Silicon, Oxygen, Phosphorus) = **one swarm of agents** with a clear mandate.

QQ Omega relies on **multiple swarms of specialists**, each with many agents inside, and then combines their views into a single, <span className="pink-glow-text">**coherent**</span> picture.
