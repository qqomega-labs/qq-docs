## 🔵 Hydrogen | On-chain Flows Swarm

Hydrogen is the simplest and most abundant element in the universe: it flows, combines, and reveals where energy actually goes.  
In QQ Omega, **Hydrogen** plays a similar role for **on-chain behavior**: it shows who really holds a token, how capital moves between actors, and how these flows change across time.

### What Hydrogen Is

The Hydrogen element focuses on **on-chain flows and holder behavior**:  
who owns the token, how concentrated that ownership is, and how balances move between clusters of actors.

Some agents track **how much capital is committed** to a protocol: TVL across chains, vaults, and strategies.  
Others follow **how fast value circulates**: trading volume, transfer activity, lending flows, liquidations and more.  
Another set of agents maps **who the key holders are**, classifying them into clear categories — CEX, companies, institutions, investors, smart contracts, dead wallets, unknown whales — and watching how their positions evolve over **24h, 7d, 30d**.

Hydrogen does not care about narratives or promises.  
It answers a harder question: *“What are the biggest on-chain actors actually doing with real money, right now and over time?”*

### Core Dimensions Hydrogen Covers

Across the swarm, Hydrogen continuously evaluates and updates a set of core flow dimensions, such as:

- **3.1 TVL – committed capital**  
  An agent focused on **Total Value Locked (TVL)**, measuring how much capital is actually parked in the protocol’s smart contracts and related vaults.
  It tracks:
  - Aggregate TVL by chain and by major product line (lending, LPs, staking, structured products, etc.)  
  - Asset composition (stablecoins vs. majors vs. long tail)  
  - TVL changes over **24h / 7d / 30d**  
  This gives a view on how **sticky or flighty** the capital is, and how sensitive it is to market moves or incentives.

- **3.2 Volumes – how fast value circulates**  
  Another agent monitors **volumes** across all relevant activities, including:
  - Trading volumes on DEXes (spot and perps where visible on-chain)  
  - Transfer volumes between key contracts and addresses  
  - Lending / borrowing flows, liquidations, repayments  
  - Bridge flows when they are part of the protocol’s usage  
  Over **24h / 7d / 30d**, this shows whether the protocol is seeing **organic usage**, speculative churn, or dead liquidity sitting still.

- **3.3 Holder Composition – who actually owns the token**  
  A dedicated agent classifies token balances by **actor category**, building a map of who controls supply.  
  Typical clusters include:
  - Centralized exchanges (CEX)  
  - Companies and project-related entities  
  - Institutions and funds  
  - Retail / individual investors  
  - Smart contracts (AMMs, lending markets, staking contracts, etc.)  
  - Dead wallets / burn addresses  
  - Unknown whales (large holders without clear labels)  

  For each cluster, it measures:
  - % of **circulating supply** held  
  - Number of wallets and concentration (e.g. top 10 holders)  
  - Share of liquid vs. locked / staked positions  

  This reveals whether the token is broadly distributed, dominated by a few players, or heavily parked on intermediaries like CEXs and DeFi contracts.

- **3.4 Holder Dynamics – who is accumulating or distributing**  
  Another agent tracks **changes in balances** across the same clusters over the last **24h / 7d / 30d**.
  It looks at:
  - Δ% supply held by each cluster (accumulation vs. distribution)  
  - Net inflows / outflows to and from CEXs  
  - Behavior of large holders and unknown whales  
  - Shifts between self-custody, smart contracts and centralized venues  

  The output is a set of clear signals on whether:
  - Whales are quietly accumulating or exiting  
  - CEX balances are rising (potential future sell pressure) or falling (withdrawals to long-term holding or DeFi)  
  - Protocol contracts are gaining or losing deposits in a way consistent with TVL and volume trends  

Taken together, these agents turn raw on-chain data into **behavioral insight**: not just who holds what, but how their posture is changing across different time horizons.

### How Hydrogen Connects to the Rest of QQ Omega

Hydrogen swarm forms the **behavioral layer** of QQ Omega’s scoring and decision system.  
It provides the on-chain truth that either **confirms or contradicts** what other swarms see.

It ensures the system always maintains a grounded, data-driven view of:

- who actually controls the token today,  
- how concentrated or diversified ownership really is,  
- whether key actors are **adding risk, reducing exposure, or staying flat**,  
- how TVL and volumes evolve across **24h / 7d / 30d** in response to market and protocol events.

Other swarms — from fundamentals (Carbon) to tokenomics (Gold) and macro regime (Oxygen) — use Hydrogen’s signals to:
- validate whether strong narratives and “good tokenomics” are supported by real capital flows,  
- detect early accumulation or distribution by important actors,  
- adjust conviction when on-chain behavior diverges sharply from off-chain storylines.

Hydrogen is where speculation meets reality: if something matters, eventually it shows up on-chain — and Hydrogen is watching.
