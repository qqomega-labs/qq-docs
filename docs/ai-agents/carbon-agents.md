Carbon is the element that makes complex life possible: it links into chains, lattices, and frameworks that remain stable under pressure.
In QQ-Omega, **Carbon** plays a similar role in understanding how structured and resilient a crypto project truly is, thanks to a coordinated swarm of narrow expert ai agents, each focused on a specific dimension of fundamental strength.

### What Carbon Is

The Carbon element focuses on fundamentals: the part of the system that connects together every verifiable fact about a protocol’s real-world resilience, from the **people** behind it to the way **value** actually moves.

Some agents go deep on **who is building**: track record, execution quality, reputation and how consistently the team has delivered in the past.  
Others map **what is being built**: the company behind, the product itself, its users, how it compares to direct competitors in the same category. 


### Core Dimensions Carbon Covers

Across the swarm, Carbon continuously evaluates and updates a set of core themes, such as:

- **People & organization**  
  Credibility, history, and operational discipline of the team, contributors, and key stakeholders.

- **Product & positioning**  
  What the protocol actually does, which problems it solves, who it serves, and how it stands against alternatives in the same segment.

- **Economic reality**  
  How (and if) the project generates revenue, the stability of that revenue over time, and its relationship with users, liquidity providers, and token holders.

- **Adoption & usage**  
  Real usage: active users, retention, and behavior of power users

- **Lifecycle & robustness**  
  Stage of development, time in production, behavior under different market conditions, and response to historical stress events.

- **Transparency & data quality**  
  Depth and honesty of documentation, clarity of public metrics, observability of flows, and the ability to cross-check claims with on-chain data.

- **Governance & control**  
  Decentralization in theory vs. practice, concentration of power, quality of proposals and discussion, and the actual influence wielded by the community.

- **Strategic relationships**  
  Presence and weight of institutional backers, strategic partners, and the depth of integrations within the broader crypto and financial ecosystem.

- **Security & resilience**  
  Security reviews, audits, disclosed vulnerabilities, incident history, quality of response, and ongoing incentives for security research.

- **Dependency & counterparty risk**  
  Reliance on external infrastructure, oracles, bridges, and upstream protocols — and what happens if any of these dependencies fail or degrade.

- **Regulatory & legal fit**  
  Exposure to jurisdictional risk, clarity of the legal framework, and alignment (or friction) with evolving regulations and industry standards.

Each agent inside Carbon contributes its own view on these dimensions, with different weights and time horizons.  
Their outputs are normalized into structured scores and qualitative notes that the rest of QQ Omega can consume, compare, and aggregate.

### How Carbon Connects to the Rest of QQ Omega

Carbon swarm forms the **fundamental backbone** of QQ Omega’s scoring and decision layer.  
It provides the slow-moving, fundamentals-first signal upon which the other swarms build.

It ensures the system always maintains a grounded, evidence-based view of **who is building**, **what exists today**, and **how durable it really is** over time.
