## What is “blue” – Fundamentals Agents

“x” agents analyse the **Fundamentals** of a project:

- **Team & founders** (experience, track record, red flags)
- **Company & structure** (jurisdiction, legal setup, governance)
- **Product** (real use case, adoption signals, competition)
- **Execution** (shipping speed, roadmap vs reality)

Their goal: answer “**Is this project fundamentally serious and credible?**”
