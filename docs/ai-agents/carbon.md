Carbon is the element that makes complex life possible: it forms chains, lattices, and frameworks that remain stable under pressure.  
In QQ Omega, <span className="gradient-text">**Carbon Swarm**</span> plays a similar role in understanding how structured and resilient a crypto project truly is, through a coordinated swarm of highly specialized AI agents, each focused on a specific dimension of **fundamental strength**.

### What Carbon Is

The Carbon Swarm focuses on fundamentals, which is the part of the system that connects every verifiable fact about a crypto project’s real-world resilience, from the <span className="pink-glow-text">**people**</span> behind it to the way <span className="pink-glow-text">**value**</span> actually moves.

Some agents go deep on **who is building** by analyzing track record, execution quality, reputation, and how consistently the team has delivered in the past.  
Others map **what is being built** by examining the company behind it, the product itself, its users, and how it compares to direct competitors in the same category.

Carbon aims to answer a primary question: *“Who is building what, and how resilient is the underlying business and organization?”*

### Core Dimensions

Across the swarm, Carbon continuously evaluates and updates a set of core themes, such as:

- **People & organization**  
  Credibility, history, and operational discipline of the team, contributors, and key stakeholders.

- **Product & positioning**  
  What the protocol actually does, which problems it solves, who it serves, and how it stands against alternatives in the same segment.

- **Economic reality**  
  How, and if, the project generates revenue, the stability of that revenue over time, and its relationship with users, liquidity providers, and token holders.

- **Product market fit**  
  Adoption and real usage, including active users, retention, and power-user behavior.

- **Lifecycle & robustness**  
  Stage of development, time in production, behavior under different market conditions, and response to historical stress events.

- **Transparency & data quality**  
  Depth and honesty of documentation, clarity of public metrics, observability of flows, and the ability to cross-check claims with on-chain data.

- **Governance & control**  
  Decentralization in theory versus practice, concentration of power, quality of proposals and discussion, and the actual influence exercised by the community.

- **Strategic relationships**  
  Presence and weight of institutional backers, strategic partners, and the depth of integrations within the broader crypto and financial ecosystem.

- **Security & resilience**  
  Security reviews, audits, disclosed vulnerabilities, incident history, quality of response, and ongoing incentives for security research.

- **Dependency & counterparty risk**  
  Reliance on external infrastructure, oracles, bridges, and upstream protocols, and what happens if any of these dependencies fail or degrade.

- **Regulatory & legal fit**  
  Exposure to jurisdictional risk, clarity of the legal framework, and alignment, or friction, with evolving regulations and industry standards.

Each agent inside Carbon contributes its own view on these dimensions, using different weights and time horizons.  
Their outputs are normalized into structured scores and qualitative notes that the rest of QQ Omega can consume, compare, and aggregate.

### How it Connects to the Rest of QQ Omega

The Carbon swarm forms the <span className="pink-glow-text">**fundamental backbone**</span> of QQ Omega’s scoring and decision layer.  
It provides the slow-moving, fundamentals-first signal upon which the other swarms build.

It ensures the system maintains a grounded, evidence-based view of **who is building**, **what exists today**, and **how durable it really is** over time.
