## What is “white” – Macro & Crypto Macro Agents

“b” agents focus on **Macro and Crypto Macro**:

- Global **liquidity and rates** (Fed, ECB, etc.)
- **Risk-on / risk-off** regimes in traditional markets
- **Bitcoin & Ethereum cycles**, halving, dominance
- **Sector rotations** (L1, L2, DeFi, Meme, RWA, etc.)

Their goal: answer “**Is the macro wind blowing in your favour or against you?**”
