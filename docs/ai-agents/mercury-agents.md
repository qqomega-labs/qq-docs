## What is “red” – Technical Analysis Agents

“a” agents look at **price action and market structure**:

- **Trends** (uptrend, downtrend, sideways)
- **Support & resistance zones**
- **Volatility and liquidity regime**
- **Momentum & mean reversion patterns**

Their goal: answer “**What is the market saying right now on the chart?**”  
They do **not** predict the future; they frame **current risk/reward and structure**.
