## How they interact with each other

Each family of agents answers a different question:

- x → “Is the project solid?”
- y → “Is the token design sustainable?”
- z → “What does on-chain behaviour really show?”
- a → “What does the chart structure say right now?”
- b → “Is the macro environment supportive or hostile?”

QQ then **combines their outputs** into:

- per-area scores (Fundamentals, Tokenomics, On-chain, TA, Macro),
- and a **global QQ Score** that reflects all dimensions together.

Different agents can disagree – and that’s the point:  
QQ exposes **where the story is strong and where it is weak**, in a single, coherent view.
