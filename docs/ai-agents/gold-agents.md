## What is “yellow” – Tokenomics Agents

“y” agents focus on **Tokenomics**:

- **Supply & emission schedule** (inflation/deflation, unlocks, vesting)
- **Allocation** (team, VCs, community, treasury)
- **Utility** (real demand drivers vs pure speculation)
- **Incentive design** (staking, rewards, farming, sinks)

Their goal: answer “**Is this token economically healthy or structurally dangerous?**”
