Gold is the element humans have historically trusted to store value: scarce, hard to debase, and difficult to fake.  
In QQ Omega, **Gold** plays a similar role in understanding how hard or fragile a token really is as a store of value, by dissecting its supply schedule, value capture mechanisms, and incentive design.

### What Gold Is

The Gold element focuses on **tokenomics**: the part of the system that defines how the token is minted, distributed, used, and eventually removed from circulation, and how all of this shapes buy and sell pressure over time.

Some agents go deep on **how supply evolves**: emission curves, unlock schedules, staking rewards, inflation and burn mechanics.  
Others map **how value flows back to holders**: buybacks, protocol revenue sharing, DeFi yields and any mechanism that creates structural demand for the token.  
Another set of agents tracks **governance and control over the token**: admin keys, bailout mechanics, and whether the token can be weaponized against holders in times of stress.

Gold expresses many of its metrics as **percentages of circulating supply**, evaluated across three rolling time windows: **24h, 7d, 30d**.  
This makes it possible to compare very different projects on a common scale and to detect changes in pressure over short and medium horizons.

### Core Dimensions Gold Covers

Across the swarm, Gold continuously evaluates and updates a set of core tokenomics themes, such as:

- **2.1 Utility**  
  Real, non-cosmetic utility available only to holders: access rights, fee discounts, governance power that matters, collateral usage, liquidity mining, protocol-native perks.  
  Gold scores how much of the demand for the token is **structural** (needed to use the system) vs. purely **speculative**.

- **2.2 % Buyback**
  How much of protocol earnings or treasury resources are used to **buy back** tokens on the market, expressed as a % of circulating supply over 24h / 7d / 30d.  
  Strong and consistent buybacks create **downside support**; weak or irregular ones are often just narrative.

- **2.3 % Inflation / Staking**  
  Net token issuance after accounting for staking rewards, emissions, and any offsetting burns, normalized by circulating supply and time window.  
  High inflation with weak offsetting demand is scored negatively; inflation that is **earned** via staking or productive activity can be partially compensated if it reinforces network security and usage.

- **2.4 % Burn**  
  Share of tokens permanently destroyed (burned) over 24h / 7d / 30d, as a % of circulating.  
  Gold distinguishes between **one-off marketing burns** and **mechanical, recurring burns** tied to core protocol usage.

- **2.5 % Unlock** 
  Scheduled unlocks for investors, team, ecosystem funds and other allocations, expressed as a % of current circulating supply over defined future windows.  
  Large, clustered unlocks without lockups, vesting safeguards or matching demand are treated as **latent sell walls**.

- **2.6 Admin Keys**  
  Level of control that privileged actors (team, multisig, foundation) retain over the token contract, emissions, treasury and upgrade paths.  
  Gold scores both **technical control** (upgradeable contracts, pausability, blacklisting) and **practical control** (small multisigs, informal governance, off-chain veto power).

- **2.7 Bailout** 
  Whether, and under which conditions, the token can be minted, re-priced or otherwise used to socialize losses, recapitalize the protocol, or bail out bad debt.  
  This dimension tracks the risk that the token is used as a **shock absorber** for failures elsewhere in the system.

- **2.8 External Yield**
  Yields offered on the token across DeFi venues considered **AAA-grade** by QQ Omega: lending markets, liquidity pools, structured products and staking derivatives.  
  Gold measures how much additional demand is created by these yields, and whether they are **organic** (backed by real fees or demand) or **subsidized** (short-lived incentive programs).

Each agents inside Gold contributes its own view on these dimensions, with different weights and time horizons.  
Their outputs are normalized into structured scores and qualitative notes that the rest of QQ Omega can consume, compare, and aggregate.

### How Gold Connects to the Rest of QQ Omega

Gold swarm forms the **monetary backbone** of QQ Omega’s scoring and decision layer.  
It provides a clear, quantified view of **who wins and who loses** from the token design, beyond marketing claims and superficial narratives.

It ensures the system always maintains a grounded, evidence-based view of:

- how **mechanism architecture** of the token actually evolve,  
- how much value truly **accrues** to holders,  
- how resilient the token is to **dilution, unlocks, governance risk and bailouts**.

Other elements build on Gold’s signal to understand when a token’s price is aligned with its economics, and when the market is ignoring hard constraints baked into its design.
