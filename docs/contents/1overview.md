# Overview

## What is QQ Omega

QQ-Omega is a data-driven scoring system for crypto projects.  
Think of it as a **quantitative and qualitative analyst for the crypto market**: it reads data, runs models, and turns complexity into **clear scores** you can actually use.

QQ-Omega breaks each project into a few **macro scores** (Fundamentals, Tokenomics, On-chain, Technical Analysis, Macro-economy) on multiple timeframes.  
Each macro score is powered by a group **AI agents**, each focused on a specific part of the analysis.

The goal: give you a **simple, comparable view** of how solid or overhyped a project is, in one place.

## Why QQ Omega exists

Crypto is noisy, fast and often emotional.  
Most people make decisions based on hype, FOMO, or random influencers.

i grandi fondamentali si rilevano narrative passeggere, 99% of Tokenomics are made for costantly dump, e chi fa i soldi non sei mai tu ma grandi istituzioni che usano i retail come exit liquidity.

QQ exists to move you from **opinion-driven decisions** to **data-driven decisions**.

- Too many dashboards, not enough synthesis → QQ aggregates and simplifies.
- Too many narratives, how to evaluate it? → QQ scores projects with a clear framework.
- Too much “trust me bro” → QQ focuses on **what really exist**.

QQ is built for users who want **financial awareness based on data** for understand where the good vibes is real and avoid to be manipulated by the market.

## How QQ Scores & AI Agents work

1. **Data collection**  
   QQ-Omega pulls organize data On-chain (holders, flows, liquidity, token, etc.) and Off-chain (product, docs, news, macro-economy) 
2. **AI agents per area**  
   Each macro score is made of **5 different organizated groups of AI agents called _____**.  
   Here's two example:
   - Fundamentals → one agent for team, one for product, one for security, etc.
   - Tokenomics → one for emissions, one for unlocks, one for utility, etc.

3. **From agents to scores**  
   - Each agent produces a **sub-score** based on its own metrics and rules.
   - Sub-scores are combined into a **macro score** (e.g. Fundamentals Score).
   - All macro scores are then aggregated into a **global QQ Score** for each project.

4. **Continuous updates**  
   As new data comes in (on-chain moves, unlocks, new partnerships, social shifts),  
   agents update their view and scores **evolve over time**.

In short:  
**Data → AI agents → Scores → Clear signals for your decisions.**
