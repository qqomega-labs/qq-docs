# AI Agents

## What is an “AI Agent”

In QQ, an **AI Agent** is a focused analytical module.  
Each agent:

- looks at a **specific area** (e.g. team, token supply, whales, charts, macro),  
- reads **structured data**,  
- outputs a **score, signal or comment** that can be combined with others.

Instead of one big model trying to do everything, QQ uses **many small specialists**.

## What is “blue” – Fundamentals Agents

“x” agents analyse the **Fundamentals** of a project:

- **Team & founders** (experience, track record, red flags)  
- **Company & structure** (jurisdiction, legal setup, governance)  
- **Product** (real use case, adoption signals, competition)  
- **Execution** (shipping speed, roadmap vs reality)

Their goal: answer “**Is this project fundamentally serious and credible?**”

## What is “yellow” – Tokenomics Agents

“y” agents focus on **Tokenomics**:

- **Supply & emission schedule** (inflation/deflation, unlocks, vesting)  
- **Allocation** (team, VCs, community, treasury)  
- **Utility** (real demand drivers vs pure speculation)  
- **Incentive design** (staking, rewards, farming, sinks)

Their goal: answer “**Is this token economically healthy or structurally dangerous?**”

## What is “green” – On-Chain Agents

“z” agents watch **On-chain behaviour**:

- **Holder distribution** (whales, concentration, retail share)  
- **Smart money** (who is buying/selling, known wallets)  
- **Liquidity** (where it is, how deep it is, fragmentation)  
- **Activity** (number of active wallets, retention, flows between chains/CEX)

Their goal: answer “**What does the blockchain say about how people really use this token?**”

## What is “red” – Technical Analysis Agents

“a” agents look at **price action and market structure**:

- **Trends** (uptrend, downtrend, sideways)  
- **Support & resistance zones**  
- **Volatility and liquidity regime**  
- **Momentum & mean reversion patterns**

Their goal: answer “**What is the market saying right now on the chart?**”  
They do **not** predict the future; they frame **current risk/reward and structure**.

---

## What is “white” – Macro & Crypto Macro Agents

“b” agents focus on **Macro and Crypto Macro**:

- Global **liquidity and rates** (Fed, ECB, etc.)  
- **Risk-on / risk-off** regimes in traditional markets  
- **Bitcoin & Ethereum cycles**, halving, dominance  
- **Sector rotations** (L1, L2, DeFi, Meme, RWA, etc.)

Their goal: answer “**Is the macro wind blowing in your favour or against you?**”

---

## How they interact with each other

Each family of agents answers a different question:

- x → “Is the project solid?”  
- y → “Is the token design sustainable?”  
- z → “What does on-chain behaviour really show?”  
- a → “What does the chart structure say right now?”  
- b → “Is the macro environment supportive or hostile?”

QQ then **combines their outputs** into:

- per-area scores (Fundamentals, Tokenomics, On-chain, TA, Macro),  
- and a **global QQ Score** that reflects all dimensions together.

Different agents can disagree – and that’s the point:  
QQ exposes **where the story is strong and where it is weak**, in a single, coherent view.
