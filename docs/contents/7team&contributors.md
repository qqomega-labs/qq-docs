# Team & Contributors

QQ-omega is built at the intersection of **engineering** and **market architecture**.
**qqalpha** turns raw blockchain data into scalable systems, while **qqsigma** designs the analytical framework and scoring logic that sit on top of it.
Together, they form **QQomega** – the synthesis of code + architecture – and define QQ’s mission: turn crypto noise into structured, actionable signal.

### Core Team

#### qqalpha – Co-Founder & Lead Developer
qqalpha is responsible for the **technical backbone** of QQ:
- Data pipelines, APIs and infrastructure
- Integration with third-party data providers and on-chain sources
- Reliability, performance and security of the core system
- Implementation of scoring logic and automation at scale

#### qqsigma – Co-Founder & System Architect
qqsigma defines the **analytical and structural logic** of QQ:
- Design of metrics, categories and scoring frameworks
- Narrative and use-case architecture (how data becomes decisions)
- Methodology for project evaluation and signal generation
- Long-term roadmap for QQ as an “alpha intelligence layer” for crypto

## Contribute to QQ-omega 🪂

QQ-omega is designed to evolve with the ecosystem: Community input is welcome to refine metrics, expand coverage and improve the overall quality of the datas. 

### Propose New Metrics or Categories

If you have ideas for:
- easy way to get fastest real time data as possible 🪂🪂🪂
- New **metrics** we should track 🪂🪂
- New **categories** of projects, narratives or entities 🪂


you can submit a proposal through the dedicated form:

👉 **Proposal Form:** `[Insert form link here]`

Please include:
- Clear name and description of the metric / category
- Why it matters (what problem it solves, what alpha it can unlock)
- Required data sources (on-chain, off-chain, social, etc.)
- Any example queries, dashboards or use cases

The team will review submissions periodically and may:
- Integrate them into the official framework
- Ask for clarifications or refinements
- Mark them as “experimental” for internal testing

### Feedback & Improvements

You can also contribute by sharing feedback on:

- Data coverage or accuracy
- Scoring logic, rankings, and output format
- UX of dashboards, docs and tooling
- Potential integrations or collaborations

Feedback can be sent through our **official channels** (listed on the main page of the docs / website).
Constructive, specific feedback has the highest chance of being integrated into future iterations of QQ.
