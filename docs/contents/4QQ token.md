## $QQ Tokenomics: 1 $QQ = 1 lifetime access

$QQ is a **pure utility token**.  
You just need to hold **1 $QQ ore more in your wallet** to unlock and use the **live QQ dashboard**, including real-time scores, rankings and alerts.  
No complex tiers, no lockups: **1 token = 1 live access**.

- Total supply `20.000` $QQ
- `45%` LP Solana (`9.000` $QQ)
- `45%` LP Base (`9.000` $QQ)
- `1,5%` Core Contributors: QQalpha (`300` $QQ)
- `1,5%` Core Contributors: QQsigma (`300` $QQ)
- `1%` Partnership (`200` $QQ)
- `6%` Airdrop (`1.200` $QQ)

### Fee Burn – How It Works

Every month, all LP fees collected in $QQ are processed as follows:

- **burn up to `500` $QQ**.
- If the fees in $QQ are more than `500` $QQ, anything above that amount is **sent to the airdrop wallet**.

So, every month:

- first `500` $QQ → burned 🔥  
- everything above `500` $QQ → airdrop wallet 🪂  

For transparency, each month we will publish clear **on-chain proofs** showing exactly how much was burned and how much was sent to the airdrop wallet.

The burn process will continue until the total supply reaches `?.???` $QQ.
