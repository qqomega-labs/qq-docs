## Architecture Design | Q3-Q4 2025

- [x] Multi-layer <span className="pink-glow-text">scoring</span> architecture defined and documented  
  (Agents → Swarms → Area Scores → Global QQ Score)

- [x] <span className="pink-glow-text">Data strategy</span> agreed and wired  
  Domains, providers and refresh cadence chosen; first ingestion + normalization layer running end-to-end.

- [x] <span className="pink-glow-text">Scoring engine</span> prototyped and internally validated  
  Core scoring logic implemented, tested on a reference basket of assets, sanity-checked vs. historical regimes and known edge cases

- [x] Engineering base set up  
  Repos, dev environment and <span className="pink-glow-text">core infras</span> bootstrapped (services, storage, internal APIs, CI skeleton)

- [x] Public-facing <span className="pink-glow-text">docs</span> live  
  QQ Omega vision, Elements, swarms and scoring model explained in clear, non-technical documentation

- [x] <span className="pink-glow-text">Tokenomics</span> defined for fair launch on Virtual Protocol  
  Fixed total supply, no private/seed allocations, no team pre-mint. Fee-driven sustainability model documented (no inflation-based emissions)

- [x] 2-year <span className="pink-glow-text">roadmap</span> defined and time-scheduled  
  Clear milestones laid out for the next 24 months, published with quarterly checkpoints and measurable deliverables.
