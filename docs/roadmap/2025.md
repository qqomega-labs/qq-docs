## Architecture Design | Q3–Q4 2025

- [x] Multi-layer <span className="pink-glow-text">scoring</span> architecture defined and documented  
  (Agents → Swarms → Area Scores → Global QQ Score)

- [x] <span className="pink-glow-text">Data strategy</span> agreed and implemented  
  Domains, providers, and refresh cadence defined; the first ingestion and normalization layer running end-to-end.

- [x] <span className="pink-glow-text">Scoring engine</span> prototyped and internally validated  
  Core scoring logic implemented, tested on a reference basket of assets, and sanity-checked against historical regimes and known edge cases.

- [x] Engineering base set up  
  Repositories, development environment, and <span className="pink-glow-text">core infrastructure</span> bootstrapped, including services, storage, internal APIs, and a CI skeleton.

- [x] Public-facing <span className="pink-glow-text">docs</span> live  
  QQ Omega vision, Elements, swarms, and scoring model explained in clear, non-technical documentation.

- [x] <span className="pink-glow-text">Tokenomics</span> defined for a fair launch on Virtual Protocol  
  Fixed total supply with a fair launch through the Pegasus model on Virtuals Protocol. Includes a fee-driven burn mechanism and documented liquidity expansion.

- [x] Two-year <span className="pink-glow-text">roadmap</span> defined and time-scheduled  
  Clear milestones laid out for the next 24 months, published with quarterly checkpoints and measurable deliverables.
