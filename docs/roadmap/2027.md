## Phase VI (Q1–Q2 2027): Strategy & Continuous Calibration

- [ ] **Strategy templates (standard)**
  - [ ] Define “Strategy Cards” (thesis, signals, risk rules, costs, failure modes)
  - [ ] Build a small library of core templates (trend, mean reversion, yield rotation)

- [ ] **Calibration loop (Score → outcome)**
  - [ ] Compare QQ Scores vs realized performance (by bucket + time horizon)
  - [ ] Tune weights/thresholds/methodology with strict versioning + rollback
  - [ ] Track stability across regimes (bull/bear, high/low vol)

- [ ] **Data reliability + coverage**
  - [ ] Expand coverage only with quality gates (freshness, confidence, anomaly filters)
  - [ ] Show metric confidence/provenance so strategies can require minimum quality


## Phase VII (Q3–Q4 2027): Personal Alpha OS

- [ ] **Goals → constraints → plan**
  - [ ] Turn user objectives into portfolio rules + allocation/rebalance plan
  - [ ] Enforce guardrails (risk budget, exposure limits, liquidity/slippage limits)

- [ ] **Explainability (no hand-waving)**
  - [ ] Auto “why it happened”: PnL attribution + event trail tied to the graph
  - [ ] Decision trace: which QQ signals triggered which actions

- [ ] **Stress + safety**
  - [ ] Scenario/stress testing + early warnings
  - [ ] Action log + post-mortems to improve future calibration
