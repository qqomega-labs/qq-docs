## Calibration & Coverage | Q1–Q2 2027

- [ ] **Continuous calibration loop**
  - [ ] Compare QQ Scores vs realized performance (by bucket + time horizon)
  - [ ] Tune weights/thresholds/methodology with strict versioning + rollback
  - [ ] Track stability across regimes (bull/bear, high/low vol)

- [ ] **Data reliability + coverage**
  - [ ] Expand coverage only with quality gates (freshness, confidence, anomaly filters)
  - [ ] Show metric confidence so strategies can require minimum quality


## Personal QQ OS | Q3–Q4 2027 

- [ ] **Portfolio/watchlist overlay**:
  - [ ] User inputs holdings/watchlist  
  - [ ] QQ shows aggregated risk profile + red flags  
  - [ ] Turn user objectives into portfolio rules + allocation/rebalance plan
  - [ ] Enforce guardrails (risk budget, exposure limits, liquidity/slippage limits)

- [ ] **Explainability**
  - [ ] Auto “why it happened”: PnL attribution + event trail tied to the graph
  - [ ] Decision trace: which QQ signals triggered which actions
