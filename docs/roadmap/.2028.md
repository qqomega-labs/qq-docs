:::note
**Blunt reality check:** a “certificate” is worthless unless *someone credible* accepts it as a signal. So QQ Learn must ship as **Proof-of-Skill** (verifiable work + audits + on-chain attestations).
:::

## QQ Learn (Deep Curriculum + Practical Labs)
- [ ] **Learning tracks** (modular, stackable):
  - [ ] DeFi Risk & Market Structure (liquidity, reflexivity, liquidation cascades)
  - [ ] Tokenomics & Incentive Design (emissions, sinks, governance capture)
  - [ ] On-chain Forensics & Wallet Intelligence (clusters, labeling, entity mapping)
  - [ ] Strategy Engineering (backtesting, regime detection, deployment hygiene)
  - [ ] Data Literacy for Crypto (Dune/Flipside, data quality, bias, survivorship)
- [ ] **Hands-on labs** (graded):
  - [ ] “Find alpha” challenges: build a thesis → define metrics → test → report
  - [ ] “Red team” challenges: break a strategy with stress scenarios
  - [ ] “Due diligence” drills: score a project and defend the score with evidence
- [ ] **QQ Learn Sandbox**:
  - [ ] Paper trading environment tied to QQ Scores + guardrails
  - [ ] Synthetic scenarios generator (liquidity shock / oracle failure / bridge halt)
  - [ ] Post-mortem templates auto-filled from user actions

## QQ Certificate = Verifiable Credential
- [ ] **Credential design**:
  - [ ] Tiered certifications (Foundations → Analyst → Strategist → Risk Engineer)
  - [ ] Each tier requires *portfolio artifacts* (reports, notebooks, dashboards)
- [ ] **Verifiability & portability**:
  - [ ] On-chain attestation (Soulbound-style or non-transferable credential)
  - [ ] Off-chain mirror (W3C Verifiable Credentials) for HR/enterprise checks
  - [ ] Public “skills graph” profile (what you can do, not what you watched)
- [ ] **Anti-gaming**:
  - [ ] Proctored capstone review (human + automated consistency checks)
  - [ ] Plagiarism / template-detection on reports
  - [ ] Evidence requirement: sources, tx links, reproducible queries

## Reputation Layer (“Proof-of-Work” in the Decentralized Money Era)
- [ ] **Reputation scoring** (separate from QQ crypto-asset scores):
  - [ ] Accuracy over time (predictions vs outcomes)
  - [ ] Risk discipline (max drawdown, rule adherence)
  - [ ] Research quality (citations, reproducibility, falsifiability)
- [ ] **Bounties & quests**:
  - [ ] Protocols sponsor research bounties (paid for audits/dashboards/analysis)
  - [ ] Users earn reputation + rewards for high-signal contributions
- [ ] **Mentor/Reviewer network**:
  - [ ] Trusted reviewers gain status; reviewers stake reputation (slashable)
