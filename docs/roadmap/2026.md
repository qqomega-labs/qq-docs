# QQ Omega – Roadmap

### Phase 0: Architecture Design ✅

- [x] Multi-layer scoring architecture defined and documented  
  (Elements → swarms → agents → area scores → global QQ Score)

- [x] Data strategy agreed and wired  
  Domains, providers and refresh cadence chosen; first ingestion + normalization layer running end-to-end.

- [x] Scoring engine prototyped and internally validated  
  Core scoring logic implemented, tested on a reference basket of assets, sanity-checked vs. historical regimes and known edge cases.

- [x] Engineering base set up  
  Repos, dev environment and core infra bootstrapped (services, storage, internal APIs, CI skeleton).

- [x] Public-facing docs live  
  QQ Omega vision, Elements, swarms and scoring model explained in clear, non-technical documentation.


### Phase 1: Token Launch 

- [x] Fair launch on Base + Solana  
- [x] Create liquidity pools on Uniswap (base) + Meteora (solana)
- [x] X channels live
- [ ] Dexscreener listing 
- [ ] Coingecko listing
- [ ] Coinmarketcap listing

### Phase 2 (Q1 2026): Data Layer + First Swarms (Oxygen, Carbon & Gold) + Dashboard v1 

- [ ] Shared data layer online (assets, timeframes, metrics)  
- [ ] **⚪️ Oxygen swarm v1** live (macro & regime view)  
- [ ] **⚫️ Carbon swarm v1** live (fundamentals view per crypto-asset)  
- [ ] **Dashboard v1** live, token-gated:
  - [ ] Wallet login + QQ-based access  
  - [ ] Per-asset ranking view with Oxygen + Carbon scores  
- [ ] Tokenomics data model + feeds wired into data layer  
- [ ] **🟡 Gold swarm v1** live  
- [ ] Dashboard upgraded with Tokenomics tab (Gold)

### Phase 3 (Q2 2026): Hydrogen, Silicon + Phosphorus Swarms (On-chain, Technical + Orchestration)
- [ ] On-chain data feeds connected to data layer  
- [ ] **🔵 Hydrogen swarm v1** live
- [ ] Market analysis connected to data layer  
- [ ] **🔴 Silicon swarm v1** live
- [ ] **🟢 Phosphorus swarm v1** live 
- [ ] Dashboard upgraded:
  - [ ] On-chain tab (Hydrogen)  
  - [ ] Technical tab (Silicon)  
- [ ] **Global QQ Score v1** defined, documented and computed per asset 

### Phase 4 (Q3-Q4 2026): Token gated REST API, Alerts, Portfolio Overlay & Integrations

- [ ] Public **REST API v1**:
  - [ ] Get scores per Element  
  - [ ] Get QQ Score + summary  
  - [ ] List/filter assets   
- [ ] First SDKs (TypeScript + Python) released  
- [ ] API documentation + example integrations published  
- [ ] **Alerts engine v1**:
  - [ ] Triggers on major score changes, regime shifts, unlock risk, on-chain flows, TA setups  
  - [ ] Webhook + basic messaging channels (e.g. Discord/Telegram bot)  
- [ ] Simple **portfolio/watchlist overlay**:
  - [ ] User inputs holdings/watchlist  
  - [ ] QQ shows aggregated risk profile + red flags  
- [ ] First external integrations (where feasible: terminal/analytics/portfolio tools)  


### Phase 5 (Q1-Q2 2027): Strategy & Continuous Calibration

- [ ] Strategy template implementation and ongoing calibration:
  - [ ] Compare QQ Scores vs. realized performance  
  - [ ] Adjust weights, thresholds, and methodologies over time  
  - [ ] Continuous expand coverage and optimize data reliability

### Cadence & Principles

- Cadence: **progressive rollout**, starting from Q1 2026, with agents released and improved on a continuous basis.
- Principles:
  - **Incremental**: add one dimension at a time, keep it explainable.
  - **Versioned**: each change tracked in the Changelog with model version.
  - **Data-first**: every new agent goes live only after passing stability and data-quality checks.
