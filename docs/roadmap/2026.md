## 2026 Roadmap

### Q1 2026 – Macro, Fundamentals, Tokenomics

In Q1 2026 we focus on the **core structural layer**:

- **Macro & Crypto Macro agents (b)**  
  Global Market regime, liquidity conditions, BTC/ETH cycle and sector rotations.
- **Fundamentals agents (x)**  
  Team, company setup, product, execution quality. - Versions - v0 – Internal alpha - v1 – Public dashboard
- **Tokenomics agents (y)**  
  Supply, emissions, unlocks, allocation and incentive design.

Objective: deliver the **first full QQ Score** driven by macro context, project quality and token design.

### Q2 2026 – On-Chain & Technical Analysis

In Q2 2026 we add the **behavioural and market-structure layer**:

- **On-chain agents (z)**  
  Holders, smart money, liquidity distribution, on-chain activity.
- **Technical Analysis agents (a)**  
  Trend, key levels, volatility and market structure.

Objective: make QQ **market-aware**, combining structural quality (Q1) with **real usage on-chain** and **price action on charts**.

### Q3 2026 – API & agent-to-agent

### Cadence & Principles

- Cadence: **progressive rollout**, starting from Q1 2026, with agents released and improved on a continuous basis.
- Principles:
  - **Incremental** – add one dimension at a time, keep it explainable.
  - **Versioned** – each change tracked in the Changelog with model version.
  - **Data-first** – every new agent goes live only after passing stability and data-quality checks.
