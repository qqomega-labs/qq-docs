## What is QQ Omega?

QQ Omega is a scoring engine that combines **quantitative** and **qualitative data** into a single framework to evaluate <span className="pink-glow-text">**every aspect of crypto assets**</span>.

Each crypto asset is evaluated across five categories: **Fundamentals, Tokenomics, On-chain, Technicals, and Macro-Economic Regime**, and across multiple timeframes. Behind each category is a swarm of **specialized AI agents**, each focused on a specific slice of analysis. You can learn more about how AI agents work for each category in the <span className="pink-badge">[AI AGENTS SWARMS](/docs/category/ai-agent-swarms)</span> section.

Their analyses are aggregated into a global <span className="pink-glow-text">**QQ score**</span>: each crypto asset receives a 0–100 score, which **updates automatically** as new data and events occur. Multiple QQ scores are generated for different **timeframes**: each timeframe applies different weights to the AI swarms. For example, short-term QQ scores are more influenced by On-chain data and Technical Analysis, while long-term QQ scores give more weight to Fundamentals and Tokenomics.

This results in **separate rankings per timeframe**, allowing you to instantly identify crypto assets that appear <span className="pink-glow-text">**undervalued**</span> or <span className="pink-glow-text">**overvalued**</span>, based on your investment horizon.

With QQ Omega, you get a clear, side-by-side view of what looks structurally strong, what looks stretched, and what is mostly hype—helping you make more informed investment decisions and maximize your win rate.

:::note
Think of QQ Omega as a <span className="pink-glow-text">**quant + qual crypto analyst**</span>: it ingests data, structures it, and compresses complexity into **clear scores, rankings, and explainable evaluations** you can use as a base layer to make **conscious investment decisions**.
