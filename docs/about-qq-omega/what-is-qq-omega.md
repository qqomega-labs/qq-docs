## What is QQ Omega

QQ-Omega is a data-driven scoring system for crypto projects.  
Think of it as a **quantitative and qualitative analyst for the crypto market**: it reads data, runs models, and turns complexity into **clear scores** you can actually use.

QQ-Omega breaks each project into a few **macro scores** (Fundamentals, Tokenomics, On-chain, Technical Analysis, Macro-economy) on multiple timeframes.  
Each macro score is powered by a group **AI agents**, each focused on a specific part of the analysis.

The goal: give you a **simple, comparable view** of how solid or overhyped a project is, in one place.
