## What is QQ Omega

QQ-Omega is a scoring engine for crypto projects that combines **quantitative data and qualitative signals** into one AI powered framework.

Think of it as a **quant + qual analyst for the crypto market** working for you: it ingests data, organizes it, and compresses complexity into **clear, actionable alpha** to strengthen your decision-making power.

Each crypto-asset is broken down into a set of **rankings**: Fundamentals, Tokenomics, On-chain, Technical Analysis, and Macro, evaluated across multiple timeframes.  
Behind every macro score there is a **set of specialized, vertical AI agents**, each focused on a specific slice of the analysis.

The result: a **simple, comparable view** of whether a project looks structurally solid, fairly priced, or just overhyped, all in one place.
