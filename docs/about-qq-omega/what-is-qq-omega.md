## What is QQ Omega?

QQ Omega is a scoring engine that combines **quantitative** and **qualitative data** into a single framework to evaluate **every aspect of crypto assets**.

Each crypto asset is evaluated across five categories: **Fundamentals, Tokenomics, On-chain, Technicals, and Macro-Economic Regime**, across multiple timeframes. Behind each category is a swarm of **specialized AI agents**, each focused on a specific slice of analysis.

Their signals are aggregated into a global **QQ score**: **each crypto asset receives a 0–10 score**, which **updates automatically** as new data and events occur. The result is a clear, side-by-side view of what looks structurally strong, what looks stretched, and what is mostly hype, helping you make more informed investment decisions and maximize your win rate.

Multiple QQ Scores are generated for different timeframes.  
Each timeframe applies different weights to the AI swarms: for example, short-term scores are more influenced by On-chain data and Technical Analysis, while long-term scores give more weight to Fundamentals and Tokenomics.

This results in **separate rankings per timeframe**, allowing you to instantly identify projects that appear **undervalued or overvalued** based on your investment horizon.

:::note
Think of QQ Omega as a **quant + qual analyst**: it ingests data, structures it, and compresses complexity into **clear scores, rankings, and explainable signals** you can use as a base layer to make **conscious, fast decisions on your investments**.
