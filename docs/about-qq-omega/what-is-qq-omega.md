## What is QQ Omega?

QQ Omega is a high-precision scoring engine that synthesizes <span className="pink-glow-text">quantitative and qualitative intelligence</span> into one coherent evaluation of crypto assets.

Each crypto asset is evaluated across five categories: **Fundamentals, Tokenomics, On-chain, Technicals, and Macro-Economic Regime**, and across multiple timeframes. Behind each category is a swarm of **specialized AI agents**, each focused on a specific slice of analysis. For a deeper view into the architecture behind each category, see the <span className="pink-badge">[AI AGENTS SWARMS](/docs/category/ai-agent-swarms)</span> section.

Their analyses are aggregated into a global <span className="pink-glow-text">QQ score</span>, assigning every crypto asset a 0 to 100 score that <span className="pink-glow-text">updates automatically</span> as new data and events unfold.

Multiple QQ scores are generated for different timeframes by applying distinct weights to the AI agents, allowing short term evaluations to emphasize On-chain data and Technical Analysis while long term assessments prioritize Fundamentals and Tokenomics.

This produces separate rankings per timeframe, enabling investors to identify crypto assets that appear <span className="pink-glow-text">undervalued</span> or <span className="pink-glow-text">overvalued</span> relative to their investment horizon.

QQ Omega provides a clear, side by side view of structural strength, market excess, and hype driven behavior, compressing complexity into explainable scores and rankings that support conscious, high conviction investment decisions.


:::note
Think of QQ Omega as a <span className="pink-glow-text">**quant + qual crypto analyst**</span>: it ingests data, structures it, and compresses complexity into **clear scores, rankings, and explainable evaluations** you can use as a base layer to make **conscious investment decisions**.
