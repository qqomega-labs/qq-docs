## How QQ Scores & AI Agents Work?

### TLDR 
**Data → AI agents → Scores → Clear overview for your decisions.**

### Details

1. **Data collection**  
   QQ Omega collects and organizes on-chain data such as holders, flows, liquidity, and token activity, as well as off-chain data such as products, documentation, news, and macroeconomic context.

2. **AI agents per area**  
   Data is grouped by category and fed into **five structured swarms of AI agents**, each dedicated to a specific analytical area.  
   For example:
   - **Fundamentals**: one agent for team, one for product, one for security, and more.
   - **Tokenomics**: one agent for buybacks, one for emissions, one for unlocks, one for utility, and more.

3. **From agents to scores**
   - Each agent produces a **sub-score** based on its own metrics and evaluation rules.
   - Sub-scores are combined using **different weights and normalization methods** into a **category score** (for example, a Fundamentals Score).
   - All category scores are then aggregated into a **global QQ Score** for each project.

4. **Continuous updates**  
   As new data becomes available, including on-chain movements, token unlocks, new partnerships, or changes in market sentiment,  
   agents update their assessments and scores **evolve over time**.
