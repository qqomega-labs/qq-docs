## How QQ Scores & AI Agents Work?

:::note
TLDR: **Data → AI agents → Scores → Clear overview for your decisions.**
:::

1. **Data collection**  
   QQ Omega collects and organizes on-chain data such as holders, flows, liquidity, and token activity, as well as off-chain data such as products, documentation, news, and macroeconomic context.

2. **AI agents per area**  
   Data is grouped by category and fed into **multiple, structured <span className="pink-glow-text">swarms of AI agents</span>**, each dedicated to a specific analytical area.
   
   Here are some examples:
   - **Fundamentals swarm**: one agent for team, one for product, one for security, and more.
   - **Tokenomics swarm**: one agent for buybacks, one for emissions, one for unlocks, one for utility, and more.

3. **From agents to scores**
   - Each agent produces a **sub-score** based on its own metrics and evaluation rules.
   - Sub-scores are combined using **different weights and normalization methods** into a <span className="pink-glow-text">**category score**</span> (for example, a Fundamentals Score).
   - All category scores are then aggregated into a <span className="pink-glow-text">**global QQ score**</span> for each project.

4. **Continuous updates**  
   As new data becomes available, including on-chain movements, token unlocks, new partnerships, or changes in market sentiment,  
   agents update their assessments and scores <span className="pink-glow-text">**evolve over time**</span>.
