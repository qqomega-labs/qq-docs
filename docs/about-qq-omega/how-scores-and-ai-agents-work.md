## How QQ Scores & AI Agents work

1. **Data collection**  
   QQ-Omega pulls organize data On-chain (holders, flows, liquidity, token, etc.) and Off-chain (product, docs, news, macro-economy)
2. **AI agents per area**  
   Each macro score is made of **5 different organizated groups of AI agents called** `TODO`.  
   Here's two example:
   - Fundamentals → one agent for team, one for product, one for security, etc.
   - Tokenomics → one for emissions, one for unlocks, one for utility, etc.

3. **From agents to scores**
   - Each agent produces a **sub-score** based on its own metrics and rules.
   - Sub-scores are combined into a **macro score** (e.g. Fundamentals Score).
   - All macro scores are then aggregated into a **global QQ Score** for each project.

4. **Continuous updates**  
   As new data comes in (on-chain moves, unlocks, new partnerships, social shifts),  
   agents update their view and scores **evolve over time**.

In short:  
**Data → AI agents → Scores → Clear signals for your decisions.**
