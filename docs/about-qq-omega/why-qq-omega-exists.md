## Why QQ Omega exists

Crypto is noisy, fast and often emotional.  
Most people make decisions based on hype, FOMO, or random influencers.

i grandi fondamentali si rilevano narrative passeggere, 99% of Tokenomics are made for costantly dump, e chi fa i soldi non sei mai tu ma grandi istituzioni che usano i retail come exit liquidity.

QQ exists to move you from **opinion-driven decisions** to **data-driven decisions**.

- Too many dashboards, not enough synthesis → QQ aggregates and simplifies.
- Too many narratives, how to evaluate it? → QQ scores projects with a clear framework.
- Too much “trust me bro” → QQ focuses on **what really exist**.

QQ is built for users who want **financial awareness based on data** for understand where the good vibes is real and avoid to be manipulated by the market.
