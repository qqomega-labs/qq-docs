QQ Omega is built at the intersection of **engineering** and **market architecture**.  
It emerges from a precise collaboration between two roles with different responsibilities: <span className="pink-glow-text">**qqAlpha**</span>, who builds and operates the technical system, and <span className="pink-glow-text">**qqSigma**</span>, who designs its structure and logic.  
Their work follows a clear progression that defines QQ Omega itself: **Alpha → Sigma → Omega**.

### **Alpha → Sigma → Omega**

- <span className="pink-glow-text">**Alpha**</span> is execution.  
  It is the full hardware and software layer that captures reality through data pipelines, integrations, and live signals.  
  Alpha answers one question: **what is happening**.

- <span className="pink-glow-text">**Sigma**</span> is architecture.  
  It is the conceptual design that organizes what Alpha produces into models, metrics, and scoring systems.  
  Sigma answers one question: **what does it mean**.

- <span className="gradient-text">**Omega**</span> is outcome.  
  It is where execution and architecture converge into decisions, rankings, and alerts.  
  Omega answers one question: **what do we do now**.

QQ Omega represents the final convergence of data, architecture, and decision, expressed as <span className="pink-glow-text">actionable signal</span>.


### <span className="pink-badge">**[@qqAlpha](https://github.com/qqalpha)**</span> | Co-Founder & Lead Developer

qqAlpha leads the **engineering and delivery** of QQ Omega.

He runs an **IT company** and brings a pragmatic “ship-it” mindset: build fast, build clean, and keep systems stable under real usage. His focus is turning ideas into production-grade software that can **scale, integrate, and stay reliable over time**.

**What he owns:**
- Data pipelines, indexing, APIs, and infrastructure
- On-chain + third-party integrations (feeds, analytics, connectors)
- Performance engineering, reliability, and security hardening
- Production implementation of logic, automation, and monitoring
- Tooling, deployments, and maintaining dev velocity without breaking things

### <span className="pink-badge">**[@qqSigma](https://github.com/qqsigma)**</span> | Co-Founder & System Architect

qqSigma leads the **system design and decision logic** of QQ Omega.

He brings an **asset management background** and approaches the product like a portfolio: define the rules, measure what matters, manage uncertainty, and avoid narratives that don’t survive contact with data. The goal is a system that produces signals that are **coherent, auditable, and repeatable**.

**What he owns:**
- Metrics, categories, and scoring frameworks (what gets measured and why)
- Rules of interpretation (how raw data becomes meaning)
- Evaluation methodologies (weighting, thresholds, confidence, time decay)
- Consistency of the model across narratives and market regimes
- Long-term architecture of the scoring engine and its evolution over time
