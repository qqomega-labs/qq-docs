QQ Omega is built at the intersection of **engineering** and **market architecture**.  
It emerges from a precise collaboration between two roles with different responsibilities: <span className="pink-glow-text">**qqAlpha**</span>, who builds and operates the technical system, and <span className="pink-glow-text">**qqSigma**</span>, who designs its structure and logic.  
Their work follows a clear progression that defines QQ Omega itself: **Alpha → Sigma → Omega**.

### **Alpha → Sigma → Omega**

- <span className="pink-glow-text">**Alpha**</span> is execution.  
  It is the full hardware and software layer that captures reality through data pipelines, integrations, and live signals.  
  Alpha answers one question: **what is happening**.

- <span className="pink-glow-text">**Sigma**</span> is architecture.  
  It is the conceptual design that organizes what Alpha produces into models, metrics, and scoring systems.  
  Sigma answers one question: **what does it mean**.

- <span className="gradient-text">**Omega**</span> is outcome.  
  It is where execution and architecture converge into decisions, rankings, and alerts.  
  Omega answers one question: **what do we do now**.

Where others stop at data or analysis, QQ Omega is built as a complete loop, turning raw information into **actionable signal**.

### <span className="pink-badge">**[@qqAlpha](https://github.com/qqalpha)**</span> | Co-Founder & Lead Developer

qqAlpha is responsible for the **technical execution** of QQ Omega:

- Data pipelines, APIs, and infrastructure
- On-chain and third-party integrations
- System performance, reliability, and security
- Production implementation of logic and automation

### <span className="pink-badge">**[@qqSigma](https://github.com/qqsigma)**</span> | Co-Founder & System Architect

qqSigma is responsible for the **architectural and conceptual design** of QQ Omega:

- Metrics, categories, and scoring frameworks
- Logical structure and interpretation rules
- Evaluation methodologies and system coherence
- Long-term architectural vision
