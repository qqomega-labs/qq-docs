## How Agents Contribute to the Final Score Over Time

Each agent:

1. **Starts with an initial rule set**
   - Based on research, backtests, and expert assumptions.
2. **Observes reality over time**
   - How do the signals correlate with real performance?
   - Which red flags really matter? Which do not?
3. **Is iteratively improved**
   - Thresholds and weights can be adjusted.
   - New features can be added, and ineffective ones removed.

As a result:

- The **contribution of each agent** to the final score becomes **more calibrated**.
- The system <span className="pink-glow-text">**learns**</span> which signals are **truly predictive** versus **pure noise**.

QQ Omega is designed as a **living system** that evolves with new data through a continuously adapting model.


## Known Limitations of the System

QQ Omega is powerful, but <span className="pink-glow-text">**not magic**</span>. Be aware of the following:

- **Data availability**
  - Accuracy depends on source quality and transparency. Some projects may have incomplete, opaque, or very recent data that requires time to mature.

- **Model assumptions**
  - Scoring rules reflect the current market structure. If market dynamics change, models must be updated accordingly.

- **Black swan events**
  - Extreme events, such as regulation, exploits, bans, or macro shocks, can temporarily move markets outside the scope of any model.

QQ Omega is a **decision-support system**, not an oracle and not a substitute for risk management or capital discipline.
