## How an agent contributes to the final score over time

Each agent:

1. **Starts with an initial rule set**
   - Based on research, backtests, and expert assumptions.
2. **Observes reality over time**
   - How did the signals correlate with real performance?
   - Which red flags really mattered? Which didn’t?
3. **Gets iteratively improved**
   - Thresholds and weights can be adjusted.
   - New features can be added, useless ones removed.

As a result:

- The **contribution of each agent** to the final score becomes **more calibrated**.
- The system learns which signals are **truly predictive** vs **pure noise**.

QQ is designed as a **living system**, not a fixed static model.
