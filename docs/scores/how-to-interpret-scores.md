## How to interpret scores

QQ uses a **0–100 score** for each area (Fundamentals, Tokenomics, On-chain, TA, Macro) and a **global QQ Score** per project.

General reading:

|   Range   |     Label      |                Meaning                 |
|:---------:|:--------------:|:--------------------------------------:|
| 🔵 80 – 100 |   very cheap   | very strong on that dimension          |
| 🟢 60 – 80  |     cheap      | solid, with some risks or unknowns     |
| 🟡 40 – 60  |   fair value   | neutral / mixed signals                |
| 🟠 20 – 40  |   expensive    | weak, several red flags                |
| 🔴 00 – 20  | very expensive | very fragile / highly risky            |


### What “cheap / expensive” means in QQ

In QQ, “undervalued / overvalued” indicate a **mismatch signal** between:

- the **quality scores** (Fundamentals, Tokenomics, On-chain, etc.)
- and the **market behaviour** in the timeframe analyzed (price, volume, narrative, flows).

Examples:

- **High quality, weak price → “cheap zone”**
  - Strong Fundamentals, Tokenomics, On-chain, but price lagging peers.
- **Low quality, strong price → “expensive zone”**
  - Weak Fundamentals or bad Tokenomics, but big hype and strong price.

QQ highlights these mismatches so you can decide to build a strategy if you want to:

- **accumulate in cheap zones**, or
- **take profit / reduce risk in expensive zones**.
