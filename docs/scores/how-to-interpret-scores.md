## How to interpret scores

QQ uses a **0–10 score** for each area (Fundamentals, Tokenomics, On-chain, TA, Macro) and a **global QQ Score** per project.

General reading:

- **8,5 – 10** → VERY CHEAP → very strong on that dimension
- **6,5 – 8,4** → CHEAP → solid, with some risks or unknowns
- **3,6 – 6,4** → FAIR VALUE → neutral / mixed signals
- **1,6 – 3,5** → EXPENSIVE → weak, several red flags
- **0 – 1,5** → VERY EXPENSIVE → very fragile / highly risky

### What “cheap / expensive” means in QQ

In QQ, “undervalued / overvalued” is **not a price prediction**.  
It is a **mismatch signal** between:

- the **quality scores** (Fundamentals, Tokenomics, On-chain, etc.)
- and the **market behaviour** (price, volume, narrative, flows).

Examples:

- **High quality, weak price → “cheap zone”**
  - Strong Fundamentals, Tokenomics, On-chain, but price lagging peers.
- **Low quality, strong price → “expensive zone”**
  - Weak Fundamentals or bad Tokenomics, but big hype and strong price.

QQ highlights these mismatches so you can decide to build a strategy if you want to:

- **accumulate in cheap zones**, or
- **take profit / reduce risk in expensive zones**.
