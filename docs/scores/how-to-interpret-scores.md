## How to interpret scores

QQ assigns a <span className="pink-glow-text">**0–100 score**</span> to each dimension (Fundamentals, Tokenomics, On-chain, TA, Macro) and a **global QQ Score** per project.

General reading:

|   Range    |      Label       | Meaning |
|:----------:|:----------------:|:----------------------:|
| 🔵 80 – 100 |   very cheap     | **high score vs market cap** → strongly undervalued |
| 🟢 60 – 80  |     cheap        | **good score vs market cap** → undervalued |
| 🟡 40 – 60  |   fair value     | **score and market cap aligned** |
| 🟠 20 – 40  |   expensive      | **low score vs market cap** → overvalued |
| 🔴 0 – 20   | very expensive   | **very low score vs market cap** → extremely overvalued |


### What “cheap / expensive” means in QQ Omega

In QQ Omega **cheap / expensive** comes from a **relative valuation check**:

- QQ takes the **market cap** of the crypto asset
- compares it against the **scores assigned by the swarms**
- and outputs how **undervalued (cheap)** or **overvalued (expensive)** the asset looks **relative to its scored quality**

Examples:

- **High scores, low market cap → “cheap zone”**
  - Strong fundamentals/on-chain/tokenomics/etc., but the market cap doesn’t reflect it yet.
- **Low scores, high market cap → “expensive zone”**
  - Weak quality signals, but market cap is inflated (often by hype / KOLs / narrative).

QQ highlights these mismatches so you can decide whether to:

- **<span className="pink-glow-text">accumulate</span> in cheap zones**, or
- **<span className="pink-glow-text">take profit / reduce risk</span> in expensive zones**.
