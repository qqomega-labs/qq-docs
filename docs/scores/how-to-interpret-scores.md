## How to interpret scores

QQ uses a **0–10 score** for each area (Fundamentals, Tokenomics, On-chain, TA, Macro) and a **global QQ Score** per project.

General reading:

|   range   |     label      |                meaning                 |
|:---------:|:--------------:|:--------------------------------------:|
|  8,5 – 10 |   very cheap   | very strong on that dimension          |
| 6,5 – 8,4 |     cheap      | solid, with some risks or unknowns     |
| 3,6 – 6,4 |   fair value   | neutral / mixed signals                |
| 1,6 – 3,5 |   expensive   | weak, several red flags                |
|  0 – 1,5  | very expensive | very fragile / highly risky            |


### What “cheap / expensive” means in QQ

In QQ, “undervalued / overvalued” is **not a price prediction**.  
It is a **mismatch signal** between:

- the **quality scores** (Fundamentals, Tokenomics, On-chain, etc.)
- and the **market behaviour** in the timeframe analyzed (price, volume, narrative, flows).

Examples:

- **High quality, weak price → “cheap zone”**
  - Strong Fundamentals, Tokenomics, On-chain, but price lagging peers.
- **Low quality, strong price → “expensive zone”**
  - Weak Fundamentals or bad Tokenomics, but big hype and strong price.

QQ highlights these mismatches so you can decide to build a strategy if you want to:

- **accumulate in cheap zones**, or
- **take profit / reduce risk in expensive zones**.
