## Known limitations of the system

QQ Omega is powerful, but **not magic**. Be conscious of:

- **Data availability**
  - We know that timing matters, but also accuracy. its for this that we try to go more close to source of datas. maintain this to the top is a evergreen priority for us, but can happen that some projects have opaque data, under-documented or very new and need time.
- **Model assumptions**
  - Some rules reflect the current market structure: if the market changes, rules must be updated.
- **Black swans**
  - Have an adjusted risk of your portfolio help you in case of extreme events (regulation, hacks, bans, macro shocks) can momentanly shake the market outside any model.

QQ Omega should be used as a **decision support tool**, not as an oracle that work without money management.
