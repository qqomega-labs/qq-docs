## Known limitations of the system

QQ is powerful, but **not magic**. Be consciuous of:

- **Data availability**
  - We know that timing matters, but also accuracy. its for this that we try to go more close to source of datas. maintein this to the top is a evergreen priority for us, but can happen that Some projects are opaque, under-documented or very new and need time.
- **Model assumptions**
  - Some rules reflect the current market structure: if the market changes, rules must be updated.
- **Lag on off-chain data**
  - Legal changes, team events, or hidden deals may not be visible immediately.
- **Black swans**
  - Have an adjusted risk of your portfolio help you in case of extreme events (regulation, hacks, bans, macro shocks) can momentanly shake the market outside any model.)

QQ should be used as a **decision support tool**, not as an oracle that work without money management.
