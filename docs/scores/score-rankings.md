## Score range & rankings

For each project, QQ can show:

- A **0–10 score** per area and global QQ Score.
- A **percentile rank** vs all tracked projects
  - (e.g. “Top 10% in Fundamentals”, “Bottom 20% in Tokenomics”).
- **3 separate rankings**, one per timeframe:
  - **24h Ranking** – Short-term positioning
  - **30d Ranking** – Mid-term positioning
  - **365d Ranking** – Long-term positioning

This lets you see quickly:

- “Great long-term, but currently under pressure short-term”, or
- “Short-term hot, but weak long-term structure”.
