QQ-omega is built at the intersection of **engineering** and **market architecture**.
**qq-alpha** turns raw blockchain data into scalable systems, while **qq-sigma** designs the analytical framework and scoring logic that sit on top of it.
Together, they form **QQ-omega** – the synthesis of code + architecture – and define QQ’s mission: turn crypto noise into structured, actionable signal.
