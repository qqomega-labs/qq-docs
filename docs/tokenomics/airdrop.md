### About the $QQ Airdrop Program

:::note
- Do not expect a complete “how to qualify” guide to be released (some hints may appear).
- There is **no guarantee** that any specific action or behavior will receive rewards.
:::

The QQ Airdrop is an ongoing program with <span className="pink-glow-text">five</span> possible reward paths, each governed by its own internal logic.

The rules and eligibility criteria are **intentionally undisclosed**. No complete specification of the mechanics is made public, although occasional hints may appear somewhere.

All authoritative information regarding the airdrop is communicated exclusively through the project’s primary channels, including the <span className="pink-badge">[@QQagents](https://x.com/QQagents)</span> account on X and these official documentation pages.

The QQ team reserves the right to modify, delay, pause, pause, or discontinue the airdrop program at any time.

Any future airdrop distributions, if they occur, are entirely discretionary. No guarantees are made regarding timing, amount, or occurrence, and no entitlement, expectation, or right to receive tokens is created.

Certain jurisdictions may be excluded from any future distributions without prior notice, and users are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations in their respective jurisdictions.

The QQ team assumes no responsibility or liability for decisions, actions, or outcomes arising from assumptions, expectations, or reliance on potential airdrop activity.
