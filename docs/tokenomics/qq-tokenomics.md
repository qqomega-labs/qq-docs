The total supply of **QQ** is split 50/50 across Base and Solana chains:

### Base

#### Token address: TBD

- **10,000 QQ** minted on Base  
  - **8,000 QQ** allocated to liquidity pools on **Uniswap v3** (100% locked)
  - **1,500 QQ** allocated to airdrops  
  - **400 QQ** allocated to core contributors  
  - **100 QQ** allocated to strategic partnerships 

### Solana

#### Token address: TBD

- **10,000 QQ** minted on Solana  
  - **8,000 QQ** allocated to liquidity pools on **Meteora** (100% locked)
  - **1,500 QQ** allocated to airdrops  
  - **400 QQ** allocated to core contributors  
  - **100 QQ** allocated to strategic partnerships  
 


### Supply Design Rationale
The Solana and Base supplies are **independent by design**.  
This architecture avoids reliance on token bridges and eliminates bridge-related risks, including custodial failures, exploits, and systemic dependencies.

Price alignment between the two ecosystems is achieved through **natural market arbitrage**, where independent liquidity and trading activity incentivize price convergence across chains without requiring a unified mint or cross-chain custody.
