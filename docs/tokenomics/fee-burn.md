### How It Works

Every month, all LP fees collected in $QQ are processed as follows:

- **burn up to 500 $QQ**.
- If the fees in $QQ on Base+Solana are more than 500 $QQ, anything above that amount is **sent to the airdrop wallet**.

So, every month:

- first 500 $QQ → burned → 🔥
- everything above 500 $QQ → airdrop wallet → 🪂

For transparency, each month we will publish clear **on-chain proofs** showing exactly how much was burned and how much was sent to the airdrop wallet.

The burn process will continue until the total supply reaches `?.???` $QQ.
