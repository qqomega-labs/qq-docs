## How It Works

Every month, LP fees collected by the dev wallet are processed according to the rules below:

### Buyback & Burn Allocation
- **25% of the LP fees** collected by the dev wallet are allocated to a **buyback and burn** mechanism for the $QQ token.
- These fees are used to **buy $QQ from the market** and then **burn the tokens permanently** on dead wallet.

### Monthly Burn Cap
- The burn is **capped at a maximum of 500 $QQ per month**.
- This cap applies **regardless of how much $QQ is bought back** during that month.

### Excess Allocation
- If, after buyback, the amount of $QQ exceeds **500 $QQ in a given month**:
  - **Up to 500 $QQ → burned 🔥**
  - **Any amount above 500 $QQ → sent to the airdrop wallet 🪂**

### Monthly Summary
Every month, the flow is:

- 25% of LP fees → buy $QQ on the market  
- First 500 $QQ → burned  
- Anything above 500 $QQ → airdrop wallet  

### Transparency
For full transparency, we will publish **on-chain proofs every month**, clearly showing:
- How much $QQ was bought back
- How much $QQ was burned
- How much $QQ was sent to the airdrop wallet

### Burn Duration
The burn process will continue until the total supply reaches **???.???.???** $QQ.
