    - Why QQ exists
    - How QQ Scores & AI Agents work

- AI Agents
  - What is an “AI Agent”
  - What is “x”
  - What is “y”
  - What is “z”
  - What is “a”
  - What is “b”
  - How they interact with each other
  - Weights between macro scores
  - Score range (0–100 / percentile / ranking)
  - Decay / time-based update mechanisms
  - How to Read QQ Scores
    - How to interpret scores
    - What “undervalued / overvalued” means in QQ
    - 3 differents timeframes time-based update mechanisms per chi vuole accellerare accettando il rischio o chi opera più sul lungo termine
    - Score range (0–100 / percentile / 3 ranking for different timeframes ( 24h, 30g, 365g)
    - Known limitations of the system
    - How an agent contributes to the final score improving by time
  - Pipeline
    - Score update frequency: we know that timing matters. its for this that we try to go more close to source of datas. maintein this to the top is a priority for us
    - Quality checks and anti-spam filters
- Tokenomics
